      <p>
        Hi! I'm Wilfried Barth, a web developer living in Chicago, IL, USA. I
        currently work at <a href="https://www.expedia.com/">Expedia</a> as a
        Software Engineer I in the Media Solutions Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        I strive to constantly improve and grow my technical skills to match
        current demands in the tech industry. I also am an ardent believer in
        sharing my knowledge with others (Many heads are better than one!).
      </p>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I am avid guitarist, yoga practitioner, and meditator.
      </p>
